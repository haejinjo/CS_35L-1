### gitk-description.txt

After running gitk, a window popped up showing the changes in the
repository and/or the selected set of commits. The top of the screen
shows the commits in chronological order with the option to look at
each commit in more detail. Clicking on the commit shown in the
screenshot, we see that in the window below information about the
branches and commits, there is the content of that patch and
commit. We can view this in a couple of different ways: as Diff, Old
version, or New Version. The lower right subwindow shows different
parts that were changed as a result of the commit.
