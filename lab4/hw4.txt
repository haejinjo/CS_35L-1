1.    I created a hw4.txt to log actions for this homework

2.    I went into the diffutils repository and checked out
      version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository into a new branch
      called  "quote" git checkout v3.0 -f -b quote

3.    I then installed my change into the new branch. I used my
      quote-3.0-patch.txt as the input:
      patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4,5. I used the add-change-log-entry-other-window Emacs function by
     first opening emacs and using the command: C-x 4 a

     I opened each of the six  modified .c files and added entries to
     the ChangeLog for the following files.
     
     emacs src/cmp.c
     emacs src/diff.c
     emacs src/diff3.c
     emacs src/dir.c
     emacs src/sdiff.c
     emacs src/util.c

6.   I then added all changes by adding them to git and commiting the
     changes:
     git add src/cmp.c src/diff.c src/diff.c src/dir.c src/sdiff.c src/util.c
     git commit -F ChangeLog

7.   Then I generated a file formatted-patch.txt:
     git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.   I then sent my patch to my partner (Anthony Xue, 304643096).
     In order to use his, I first checked out version 3.0 again into a
     temporary branch called partner:
     git checkout v3.0 -f -b partner

     I then applied his patch using:
     git am < anthony-patch.txt
     The output was:
     Applying: 2016-04-23 Anthony Kuangyi Xue
     <kuangyi@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu>

     Then I rebuilt using the commands:
     ./bootstrap
     ./configure
     make
     make check

9.   I verified that the ChangeLog entry works by running:
     make distdir
     cd diffutils*
     emacs ChangeLog

     I saw that the ChangeLog entry was there and the patch notes
     reflected the ones that my partner had written.

10.  I went into the directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and ran the
     command gitk on it
     cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
     gitk
