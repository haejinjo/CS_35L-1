### SERVER ###

1. I first acted as the server. In Ubuntu, I made sure that openssh-server and
   openssh-client were installed:
   dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
   
   The output is as follows:
   openssh-client					install
   openssh-server					install
   openssh-sftp-server					install

   indicating that openssh-server and openssh-client are indeed installed.
   
2. I generated public and private keys and saved to the default location:
   ssh-keygen
   I was prompted to enter a passphrase, so I did.

3. I created an account for the client (my partner) and a password:
   sudo useradd -d /home/axue1 -m axue1
   sudo passwd axue1

4. I cd'd into the directory I just made and created a .ssh directory
   cd /home/axue1
   sudo mkdir .ssh
   
   I checked to make sure that it was successfully created by using:
   ls -a

5. I changed ownership and permissions on the .ssh directory
   sudo chown -R axue1 .ssh
   sudo chmod 700 .ssh

6. I used the command:
   ifconfig
   to get my ip address so that my partner could connect to my machine. Once he
   connected, he opened Firefox, which opened the GUI on his machine. I verfied
   this by running the command:
   who
   and I saw that he was connected to my machine and that his ip address matched
   mine:
   axue1    pts/15       2016-05-04 15:57 (10.97.85.159)

   Then I checked the processes that were being run and searched for his
   username:
   ps -aux | grep axue1

   And I saw that he was running Firefox:
   axue1     2891 16.7  3.3 957496 202956 pts/15  Sl+  15:57   0:06
   /usr/lib/firefox/firefox 

### CLIENT ###
   
7.  We then reversed roles, and I acted as the Client.
         
8.  I generated public and private keys:
    ssh-keygen
    I was prompted to enter a passphrase. This time I left it blank, and I saved
    them to the default location.

9.  My partner then gave me the login information that he created, along with
    the ip address. I then copied the public key to the server for key-based
    authentication using the command:
    ssh-copy-id -i echuu@169.232.121.139
    I was asked if I wanted to continue connecting. I answered yes.

10. I then added the private key to the authentication agent:
    ssh-add

11. Then I ssh'd into the server:
    ssh -X echuu@169.232.121.139

12. I ran firefox. My partner checked on his computer to see that I was indeed
    running firefox on his machine. I ran also ran ifconfig and saw that his ip
    addresss showed up. Connection success!
