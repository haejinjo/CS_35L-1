1. I used the wget command to download the old stable version of
   coreutils, unzipped it, and tried building it. I used the commands:
   tar xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
   I then went into the core-utils-with-bug directory:
   ./configure
   make
   When I ran configure, there were no problems, but when I ran the
   command make, it failed.

2. I then downloaded the patch given to us.
   wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
   Then I applied the patch:
   patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
   which gave the following output:
   patching file lib/utimens.c
   patching file lib/utimens.h
   patching file src/copy.c
   patching file src/tee.c
   patching file src/touch.c

   I tried making the file again, and this time I was able to build
   everything with no problems. The patch fixed it because the patch
   renamed the functions and added 'coreutils_' before the function
   names, which were causing problems with the build previously.

3. Now I had to reproduce the bug. I created a tmp directory and
   created the three files as shown in the spec.
   touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
   touch now
   sleep 1
   touch now1
   TZ=UTCO ~/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time

   We see that the wwi-armistice file is shown above the two other
   files, which clearly were created afterwards. Thus, I have
   successfully recreated the bug.

4. I next used gdb to debug and figure out what was causing the
   problem. I went into the src directory and opened the ls.c file to
   first look through the code to find somewhere to start. Since there
   was a problem with the way the files were outputted, I figured that
   the the sort_files function might have some issues. To see what was
   going on when this function is called, I put a couple breakpoints at
   in sort_files by using the following command in gdb.
   b sort_files
   b compare_mtime
   run -lt

   Once I hit the breakpoint at sort_files, I single-stepped through
   the program to try to find the problem. I traced the code to the
   function call compare_mtime to timespec_cmp to get_stat_mtime and
   finally to timespec_cmp, where I saw that there was a difference
   being calculated:

   int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;

   I printed out the values of the difference. The first value was a
   large negative number and the second value was a large positive
   number, so we would expect diff to be negative. However, when I
   printed out the value of diff, I got a large positive number, so
   it's clear that overflow has occurred. The output is as follows:

   (gdb) p a.tv_sec
   $70 = -1613826000
   (gdb) p b.tv_sec
   $71 = 1461898912
   (gdb) p diff
   $72 = 1219242384


   During the step through of the program, gdb showed that the
   timespec_cmp function was in ../lib/timespec.h so I opened
   timespec.h file in emacs and looked through the implementation.

   I looked at the timespec_cmp function and saw that it returned
   negative, zero, or positive depending on the integer comparisons of
   the arguments passed in. However, large positive integers can
   overflow and end up being stored as negative numbers, which would
   make the comparisons inaccurate and result in unexpected sorting of
   the files. We can replace this implementation by using signed long
   long int instead of a regular int so that we can store larger
   positive integers and avoid overflow. Then I expanded out the
   comparisons and returned -1, 0, or 1 based on which values were
   larger. 

   I then made a ChangeLog entry with the command:
   C-x 4 a
   
   After building coreutils again with the changes I made in
   timespec.h, I tested that my modifications actually fixed the
   bug. I ran the command like before:

   TZ=UTCO ~/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time

   and the output, displayed below, shows that the order of the files
   is now correct, with the wwi-armistice file at the bottom of the list.
