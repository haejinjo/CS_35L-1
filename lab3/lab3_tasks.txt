CS 35L Lab 3
- build application containing shell script that invokes ls command to get file status
- uses ls implementation supplied by Coreutils 7.6
- problem: ls command generates different output for different users (different locales)
- users want traditioal Unix format:

Homework 3 Python
- write script comm.py in style of randline.py
- implement the `comm` command
	- support all options and operands required by POSIX
	- support all environment variables required by POSIX
	- diagnostics?
	- report an error if given wrong number of input operands
	- support an extra option -u which allows `comm` to work even if its inputs are not
	  sorted
	- output lines should appear in the same order as input lines
	- output according to the first input file's order
		- lines that appear only in the second input file should appear after all
		  other lines
	- implementation should use lcoale and string modules and modules that randline.py
 	  already uses
		- change usage message to accurately describe modified behavior
	- Port comm.py implementation to Python 3 - as few changes as possible
