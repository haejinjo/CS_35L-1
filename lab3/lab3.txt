# I used my own linux machine for the lab, files may be different than from
  those on machines on linux server

1. I first grabbed Coreutils 7.6 by using the wget command:
   wget "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz"
2. unzip the .tar.gz file using the tar command:
   tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
3. I made a temporary directory in the home directory to store Coreutils
   mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
4. I then went into the coreutils-7.6 directory and read the INSTALL file to get
   figure out how to compile and install coreutils-7.6
5. I ran configure and changed where the coreutils would be installed
   ./configure --prefix=/home/eric/coreutilsInstall
   Note that per the INSTALL file's instructions, the prefix must be an absolute
   path.
   I compiled coreutils by using: make
   I installed coreutils by using: make install
   coreutils was then installed into the directory I initially made.
6. I then tested the unmodified version of the ls command
   /home/eric/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l
   Some of the output is as follows: 

   -rwxr-xr-x 1 eric users 149333 2016-04-14 12:35 wc
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 eric users 211177 2016-04-14 12:35 who
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 eric users  93488 2016-04-14 12:35 whoami
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 eric users  92050 2016-04-14 12:35 yes

   I found that the problem with the date format was there, as seen in the
   output above.
7. I copied the patch file's contents into a new file I created called
   patch_file
8. I applied the patch by using the command:
   patch -p1 < patch_file
   I used the option -p1 because I created my patchfile in the coreutils-7.6
   directory, and the ls.c file was at src/ls.c so to get the patch file to
   match this, I stripped off the a/ that preceded src/ls.c
9. In the coreutils-7.6 directory, I then built the fixed version (without
   installing it) using:
   make
   The commands that were outputted are as follows:

   make  all-recursive
   Making all in lib
   make  all-recursive
   Making all in src
   make  all-am

       CC     ls.o
       CCLD   dir
       CCLD   vdir
       CCLD   ls

   Making all in man

       GEN    dir.1
       GEN    vdir.1
       GEN    ls.1

   Making all in po
   Making all in tests
   Making all in gnulib-tests
   make  all-recursive


   Since we only altered the ls.c file, commands that were made pertaining to
   other files are not needed, so the only ones we needed are ones deal with ls.

10. To test if it works, I ran the command:
    /home/eric/CS/CS35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
    
    Some of the output is as follows:
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users  21907 Sep  1  2009 who.c
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users  88760 Apr 14 12:35 who.o
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users      0 Apr 14  2015 year_old_file
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 eric users  92050 Apr 14 12:35 yes
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users   2458 Sep  1  2009 yes.c
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users  18984 Apr 14 12:35 yes.o

    Then I ran it on a file recently created and a file that was a year old.
    touch -t 201504140000 year_old_file
    touch recent_file

    The command does work and the date shown for the files were:
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users      0 Apr 14  2015 year_old_file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 eric users      0 Apr 14 13:41 recent_file
    
    When I ran the command on a recent file, a more specific time was shown,
    while when running the command on a year-old file, I only saw the date and
    year of the file. 

    Note that the old version of ls in the temporary folder still does not
    works since I did not overwrite the old one.
    If I issue the command:
    /home/eric/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l

    The output still gives dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
