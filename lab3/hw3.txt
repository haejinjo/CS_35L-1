Q1. Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was
duplicate code that would have been caught by the switch statement. It was not
necessary to take it out, but it makes the code cleaner and easier to
understand. 

Q2. If we adopt the patched version of Coreutils, we would still need to watch
out for problems with users from other countries who may not be accustomed to
the "traditional" date format. The abbreviations used for months may not be
clear, so more confusion could arise. 

Q3. When the script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null:
    python randline.py /dev/null
    we get a "IndexError: list index out of range" since there are no lines in
    the list. 

Q4. If we run the script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, then we
    get complaints about the syntax instead, since the two version of Python
    have different conventions/syntax.
    The error is as follows:
    
    File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
