I wrote the program sfrobu, which was a rewritten version of the sfrob
program. The sfrobu program used system calls, and at the end of the program, it
outputs the number of comparisons done by the program. In order to measure and
compare the performance between the sfrob and sfrobu programs, I used the time
command while running the programs on inputs of varying nubers of input lines.
